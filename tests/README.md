10 test scripts are created from  requirement spreadsheet.
the test script names specify which req they test.

Inside most test script, multiple scenarios are tested to see whether or not the
program passes all of the scenarios.
This helps make sure that the program is fully functional and doesnt cause any errors.
If 1 scenario is failed, the whole test will fail. So program needs to pass all scenarios.

make clean;make needs to be done before running any type of tests
